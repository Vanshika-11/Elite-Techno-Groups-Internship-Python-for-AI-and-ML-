# What is JSON
◾ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.<br>
◾ It is used for storing and transporting data when data is sent from a server to a web page.<br>
◾ It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. <br>
◾ JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.<br>
◾ JSON is built on two structures:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ▪️ A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ▪️ An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.<br>
